watch out two things import

list if doesn't use generic, any object could be assigned in it 

watch out the number in the switch

Object reference access function: which functions could be accessed, which version

Stringbuilder() could not have double and boolean in it

same package, even not extends, protected could be used

watch out for loop

LocateTime.now()

stringbuilder doesn't have equals() method

while(true) infinite  while(false) terminate

java is platform independence

trim() only removes spaces at the beginning or end of a String

finally order must be last

difference between int one = 0, two = 0 and int one, two = 0

package statement must be the first line
